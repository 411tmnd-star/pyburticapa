# Tree of Thoughts and LATS: Deliberate Search

A single chain-of-thought trajectory has no room to backtrack. ToT (Yao et al., 2023) turns reasoning into a tree with self-evaluation on each node. LATS (Zhou et al., 2024) unifies ToT with ReAct and Reflexion under Monte Carlo Tree Search. Game of 24 goes from 4% (CoT) to 74% (ToT); LATS hits 92.7% pass@1 on HumanEval.
