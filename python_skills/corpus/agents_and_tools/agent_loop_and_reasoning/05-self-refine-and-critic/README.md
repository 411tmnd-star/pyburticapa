# Self-Refine and CRITIC: Iterative Output Improvement

Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) uses one LLM in three roles — generate, feedback, refine — in a loop. Average gain: +20 absolute on 7 tasks. CRITIC (Gou et al., 2023) hardens the feedback step by routing verification through external tools. In 2026 this pattern ships in every framework as "evaluator-optimizer" (Anthropic) or a guardrail loop (OpenAI Agents SDK).
