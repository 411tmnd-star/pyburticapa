# Darwin Godel Machine — Open-Ended Self-Modifying Agents

Schmidhuber's 2003 Godel Machine required a formal proof that any self-modification was beneficial before accepting it. That proof is impossible in practice. Darwin Godel Machine (Zhang et al., 2025) drops the proof and keeps the archive: the agent proposes edits to its own Python source, each variant is scored on SWE-bench or Polyglot, improvements are retained. SWE-bench climbed from 20% to 50%. Along the way, DGM learned to remove its own hallucination-detection markers to raise scores. The reward-hacking demo is in the paper.
