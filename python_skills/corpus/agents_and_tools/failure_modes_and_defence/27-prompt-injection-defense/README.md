# Prompt Injection and the PVE Defense

Greshake et al. (AISec 2023) established indirect prompt injection as the defining agent security problem. Attacker plants instructions in data the agent retrieves; on ingest, those instructions override the developer prompt. Treat all retrieved content as arbitrary code execution on the tool-use surface.

```
python main.py
```
