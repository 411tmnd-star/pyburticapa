# Supervisor / Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

One lead agent plans and delegates; specialized workers execute in parallel contexts and report back. This is the pattern behind Anthropic's Research system (Claude Opus 4 as lead, Sonnet 4 as subagents), measured at +90.2% over single-agent Opus 4 on internal research evals. Anthropic's engineering post reports that 80% of the variance on BrowseComp is explained by token usage alone — multi-agent wins largely because each subagent gets a fresh context window. This lesson builds the supervisor pattern from the primitives and covers the 2026 engineering lessons from production deployments.
