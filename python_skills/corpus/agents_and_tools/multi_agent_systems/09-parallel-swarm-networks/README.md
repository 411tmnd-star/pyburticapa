# Parallel / Swarm / Networked Architectures

Contrast with supervisor: no central decider. Agents read a shared event bus, pick up work asynchronously, write results back. LangGraph explicitly supports "Swarm Architecture" for decentralized, dynamic environments. Matrix (arXiv:2511.21686) represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues to eliminate the orchestrator bottleneck. The tradeoff is explicit: determinism and traceability for scalability. Swarm fits tasks with many independent sub-problems; it does not fit tasks that need a single coherent plan.
