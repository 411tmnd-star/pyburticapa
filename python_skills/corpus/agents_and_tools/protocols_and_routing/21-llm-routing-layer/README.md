# LLM Routing Layer — LiteLLM, OpenRouter, Portkey

Provider lock-in is expensive. Different tool-calling workloads suit different models. Routing gateways give one API surface, retries, failover, cost tracking, and guardrails. Three archetypes dominate 2026: LiteLLM (open-source self-hosted), OpenRouter (managed SaaS), Portkey (production-grade, open-sourced in March 2026). This lesson names the decision criteria and walks a stdlib routing gateway.
