# The Tool Interface — Why Agents Need Structured I/O

A language model produces tokens. A program takes actions. The gap between those two is the tool interface: a contract that lets the model request an action and the host execute it. Every 2026 stack — function calling on OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini; MCP's `tools/call`; A2A's task parts — is a different encoding of the same four-step loop. This lesson names the loop and shows the minimum machinery to run it.

```
python main.py
```
