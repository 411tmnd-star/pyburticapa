# ControlNet, LoRA & Conditioning

Text alone is a clumsy control signal. ControlNet lets you clone a pretrained diffusion model and steer it with a depth map, pose skeleton, scribble, or edge image. LoRA lets you fine-tune a 2B-parameter model by training 10 million parameters. Together they turned Stable Diffusion from a toy into the 2026 image pipeline that ships at every agency.
