# Audio Generation

Audio is a 1-D signal at 16-48 kHz. A five-second clip is 80-240k samples. No transformer attends to that sequence directly. The solution for every production audio model in 2026 is the same: a neural codec (Encodec, SoundStream, DAC) compresses audio to discrete tokens at 50-75 Hz, and a transformer or diffusion model generates tokens.
