# Janus-Pro: Decoupled Encoders for Unified Multimodal Models

Unified multimodal models have an unavoidable tension. Understanding wants semantic features — SigLIP or DINOv2 output vectors rich with concept-level information. Generation wants reconstruction-friendly codes — VQ tokens that compose back into crisp pixels. The two goals are not compatible in a single encoder. Janus (DeepSeek, October 2024) and Janus-Pro (DeepSeek, January 2025) argue the fix is to stop trying: decouple the two encoders. Share the transformer body between tasks, but route understanding through SigLIP and generation through a VQ tokenizer. At 7B, Janus-Pro beats DALL-E 3 on GenEval while matching LLaVA on MMMU. This lesson reads why two encoders work where one fails.
