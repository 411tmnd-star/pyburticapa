# Omni Models: Qwen2.5-Omni and the Thinker-Talker Split

GPT-4o's product demo in May 2024 was disruptive not because of the underlying model but because of the product shape — a voice interface where you talk, the model sees what the camera sees, and it talks back in under 250ms. The open ecosystem spent the rest of 2024 and 2025 racing to reach that product surface. Qwen2.5-Omni (March 2025) is the reference open design: a Thinker (large text-generating transformer) plus a Talker (parallel speech-generating transformer), linked by streaming speech tokens. Mini-Omni simplified it, Moshi matched its latency, GLM-4-Voice extended it to Chinese. This lesson reads the Thinker-Talker architecture and the latency budget that makes streaming real-time dialogue work.
