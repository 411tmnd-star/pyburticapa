# Instruction-Following as Alignment Signal

Every later critique of RLHF argues against this pipeline. Before you study how optimization pressure distorts a proxy, you have to see the proxy. InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) defined the reference architecture: supervised fine-tuning on instruction-response pairs, a reward model trained on pairwise preference rankings, and PPO against the reward model with a KL penalty to the SFT policy. A 1.3B InstructGPT was preferred over a 175B GPT-3. That single result is the reason every frontier lab in 2026 still ships an RLHF-shaped post-training pipeline.
