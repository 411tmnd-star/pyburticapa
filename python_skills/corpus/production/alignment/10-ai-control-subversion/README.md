# AI Control — Safety Despite Subversion

Greenblatt, Shlegeris, Sachan, Roger (Redwood Research, arXiv:2312.06942, ICML 2024). Control reframes the safety question: given an untrusted strong model U that may be adversarially optimizing against you, what protocols let you extract useful work while bounding the probability of an unacceptable outcome? Resources are a trusted weaker model T, a budget of trusted human labor H, and the ability to edit U's outputs. Within this frame, Trusted Editing Pareto-dominates Untrusted Monitoring on code-backdoor tasks. The frame inherits worst-case assumptions from security engineering: safety is the probability that an adversarially chosen U cannot cause a concrete unacceptable outcome, measured under red-team pressure that stands in for U.
