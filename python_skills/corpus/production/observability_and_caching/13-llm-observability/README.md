# LLM Observability Stack Selection

The 2026 observability market splits into two categories. Development platforms (LangSmith, Langfuse, Comet Opik) bundle monitoring with evals, prompt management, session replays. Gateway/instrumentation tools (Helicone, SigNoz, OpenLLMetry, Phoenix) focus on telemetry. Langfuse is MIT-licensed core with strong OSS balance (50K events/month free cloud). Phoenix is OpenTelemetry-native under Elastic License 2.0 — excellent for drift/RAG visualization, not a persistent production backend. Arize AX uses zero-copy Iceberg/Parquet integration claiming 100x cheaper than monolithic observability. LangSmith leads for LangChain/LangGraph, $39/user/mo, self-host in Enterprise only. Helicone is proxy-based with 15-30 min setup, 100K req/mo free, but less depth on agent traces. Common production pattern: Gateway (Helicone/Portkey) + eval platform (Phoenix/TruLens) glued by OpenTelemetry.
