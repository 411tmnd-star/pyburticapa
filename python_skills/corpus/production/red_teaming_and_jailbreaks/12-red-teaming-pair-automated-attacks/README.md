# Red-Teaming: PAIR and Automated Attacks

Chao, Robey, Dobriban, Hassani, Pappas, Wong (NeurIPS 2023, arXiv:2310.08419). PAIR — Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement — is the canonical automated black-box jailbreak. An attacker LLM with a red-team system prompt iteratively proposes jailbreaks for a target LLM, accumulating attempts and responses in its own chat history as in-context feedback. PAIR typically succeeds within 20 queries, orders of magnitude more efficient than GCG (Zou et al.'s token-level gradient search) and without requiring white-box access. PAIR is now a standard baseline in JailbreakBench (arXiv:2404.01318) and HarmBench, alongside GCG, AutoDAN, TAP, and Persuasive Adversarial Prompt.
