# Many-Shot Jailbreaking

Anil, Durmus, Panickssery, Sharma, et al. (Anthropic, NeurIPS 2024). Many-shot jailbreaking (MSJ) exploits long context windows: stuff hundreds of faux user-assistant turns where the assistant complies with harmful requests, then append the target query. Attack success follows a power law in the number of shots; fails at 5 shots, reliable at 256 shots on violent and deceitful content. The phenomenon follows the same power law as benign in-context learning — the attack and ICL share an underlying mechanism, which is why defenses that preserve ICL are hard to design. Classifier-based prompt modification reduces attack success from 61% to 2% on tested settings.
