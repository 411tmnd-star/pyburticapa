# Cold Start Mitigation for Serverless LLMs

A 20 GB model image takes 5-10 minutes (7B) to 20+ minutes (70B) to go from cold to serving. In a true serverless world, that is not a warm-up — it is an outage. Mitigations operate at five layers: pre-seeded node images (Bottlerocket on AWS, dual-volume arch), model streaming (NVIDIA Run:ai Model Streamer, native in vLLM), GPU memory snapshots (Modal checkpoints, up to 10x faster restart), warm pools (`min_workers=1`), tiered loading (ServerlessLLM's NVMe→DRAM→HBM pipeline, 10-200x latency reduction), and live migration that moves input tokens (KB) rather than KV cache (GB). Modal publishes 2-4s cold starts as a floor; Baseten 5-10s default, sub-second with pre-warming. This lesson teaches you to measure, budget, and stack the five layers.
