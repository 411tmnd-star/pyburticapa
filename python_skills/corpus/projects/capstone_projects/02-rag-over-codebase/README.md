# Capstone 02 — RAG over Codebase (Cross-Repo Semantic Search)

Every serious engineering org in 2026 runs an internal code search that understands meaning, not just strings. Sourcegraph Amp, Cursor's codebase answers, Augment's enterprise graph, Aider's repomap, Pinterest's internal MCP — same shape. Ingest many repos, parse with tree-sitter, embed function- and class-level chunks, hybrid-search, re-rank, answer with citations. This capstone asks you to build one that handles 2M lines of code across 10 repos and survives incremental re-indexing on every git push.

```
python main.py
```

Needs: standard library only

| File | Open it to… |
|---|---|
| [`main.py`](main.py) | read and run the code |
| [`ts/`](ts) | files the code uses |
| [`HOW_IT_WORKS.md`](HOW_IT_WORKS.md) | understand how the code is built |
| [`THEORY.md`](THEORY.md) | learn the idea behind it |
| [`LINKS.md`](LINKS.md) | quiz, diagrams, other languages, skill files, the original |
