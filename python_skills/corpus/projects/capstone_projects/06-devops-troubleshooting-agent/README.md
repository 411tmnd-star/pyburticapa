# Capstone 06 — DevOps Troubleshooting Agent for Kubernetes

AWS's DevOps Agent went GA, Resolve AI published its K8s playbooks, NeuBird demoed semantic monitoring, and Metoro tied AI SRE to per-service SLOs. The production shape is settled: an alert webhook fires, an agent reads telemetry, walks a graph of K8s objects, ranks root-cause hypotheses, and posts a Slack brief with approval buttons. Read-only by default. Every remediation gated by a human. This capstone is that agent, evaluated on 20 synthetic incidents and compared against AWS's Agent on three shared cases.
