# Capstone 09 — Code Migration Agent (Repo-Level Language / Runtime Upgrade)

Amazon's MigrationBench (Java 8 to 17) and Google's App Engine Py2-to-Py3 migrator set the 2026 bar. Moderne's OpenRewrite does deterministic AST rewrites at scale. Grit targets the same problem with codemod-style DSL. The production pattern combines both: a deterministic substrate for safe rewrites plus an agent layer for the ambiguous cases, a sandbox for per-branch builds, and a test harness that flips green before the PR opens. The capstone is to migrate 50 real repos and publish a pass rate with a failure taxonomy.
