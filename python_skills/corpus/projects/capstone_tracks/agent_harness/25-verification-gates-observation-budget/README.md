# Capstone Lesson 25: Verification Gates and the Observation Budget

An agent harness without a verification layer is a wish in a trenchcoat. This lesson builds the deterministic gate chain that decides whether a tool call is allowed to fire, how much of its output the agent is allowed to see, and when the loop has to stop because the agent has read too much. The chain is a function of small, named gates plus an observation ledger that tracks every token the model has been shown.
