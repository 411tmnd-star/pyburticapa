# Capstone Lesson 29: End-to-End Coding Agent on the Harness

Track A's payoff. This lesson stitches the gate chain, the sandbox, the eval harness, and the OTel spans into one working coding agent that fixes a real (small, fixture-scale) bug in a multi-file Python project. The agent is a deterministic policy, not an LLM; the substitution makes the lesson reproducible and shows that the harness was the interesting part all along. The contract is identical: a real model plugs in at the policy seam.
