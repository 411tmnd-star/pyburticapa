# Multi Round-Trip Requests and Elicitation

A server that needs the user's confirmation mid call does not hold a connection open and wait. It ends the call, hands the client a receipt, and lets a brand new request pick up where the first one left off.

```
python code/main.py
```

Needs: standard library only  ·  Tests: `python -m unittest discover -s code/tests`
